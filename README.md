# Auto-TOW
Automatically plays tug of war from ink games for you (mainly a personal project rather than somthing refined)
This is a program that reads screen data and reacts based off of color overlap rather than reading ingame code which needs injection, while technically both can break TOS, this is far safer and not meant for roblox exploiting.
